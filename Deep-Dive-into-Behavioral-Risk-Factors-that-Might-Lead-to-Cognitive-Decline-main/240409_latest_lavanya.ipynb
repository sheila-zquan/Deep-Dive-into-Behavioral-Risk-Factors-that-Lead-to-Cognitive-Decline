The workflow involved obtaining the 2022 BRFSS dataset, choosing features for examination in predictive models based on risk factors previously identified in studies on cognitive decline, conducting exploratory data analysis, testing various models, and presenting the findings. The methodologies investigated in this notebook include Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Neural Networks.\n","\n","\n","1.   **Part 1:** Getting and Cleaning the Data\n","*   Get the
